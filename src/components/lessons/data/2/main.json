And that's true - many Slavic nations, like Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians etc. use the Cyrillic. However, western Slavs - Poles, Czechs and Slovakians - use the set of signs that is nothing more but an expanded version of the Latin alphabet. If you are scared right now, don't worry - Polish language has only 9 extra letters, and I'm sure you're going learn them easily. By the way, let me show you how we say \"an alphabet\" in Polish. There are 2 ways for it: just \"alfabet\" or, less but still used, \"abecad≈Ço\". How do we pronounce it? Check below üòâ"
