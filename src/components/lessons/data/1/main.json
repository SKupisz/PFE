As you may know, it's a western Slavic language, used by almost 70 million people all around the world, including almost 38 million citizens.

Many people who don't speak Polish are claiming it's the hardest language to learn. Even I, as a native Pole, get confused sometimes by my mother tongue. But don't worry - I'm going to do my best to transfer my knowledge to you as precisely as possible. Ok, enough with the theory, now let's start. At first, I'll show you some of our greetings. Below, you'll find some formal examples: "
